# MSFSTouchPortalPlugin-PanelGrabber
MSFS 2020 Panel Grabber for Touch Portal

This is Plugin for Touch Portal to show the content of a docked out panel of MSFS 2020.
It is not perfect an could be much more faster!

More Info will come in the next days

I am using an HDMI Dummy Plug to create an virtual Screen to move the panel to it and grab the screenshots from there.

- Download the plugin from plugin directory
- click the gear icon in Touch Portal and choose "import plugin"
